# CycleGame
# A TRON-style GAME
With trails forming from the start, it is easy to see that this game
is a battle of wits and skill. Just as in the movie/game TRON, users
must beat each other by cutting the other player off, causing them to 
run into the tail of the opponent. It is a thrilling chance to see
who can move around the board better and smarter to gain the victory!
